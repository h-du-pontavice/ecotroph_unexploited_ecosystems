# ecotroph_unexploited_ecosystems
R scripts to run the EcoTroph model in a theoretical unexploited ecosystem and analyse climate change effects

WARNING: In this repository, you will find an original implementation of the EcoTroph modelling framework (Gascuel 2005, Gascuel et al. 2011), which is completely independent of the EcoTroph Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EcoTroph/index.html). 

EcoTroph is a simplified semi-empirical model of the flow of biomass through the food web, from primary producers to top predators (Gascuel 2005, Gascuel et al. 2011). It has been used in particulat to assess the ecosytem impact of fishing. In this implementation of EcoTroph, biomass and production of upper trophic levels (at each trophic level) are calculated based on the trophic transfer efficiency and the flow kinetic at each trophic level, using sea water temperature and net primary production as the only model inputs. 

The details and the theoretical basis about the implementation of EcoTroph available in this repository would be presented in du Pontavice et al., Subm. to Global Change Biology.

How to run those scripts?
1. Open the R script: EcoTroph_core_function.R. 
2. Run the first lines and the fonction called "ecotroph_core". 
3. Try to use ecotroph with the examples at the end of the script (4 examples) 
  or use your own data following the details in the R script.
